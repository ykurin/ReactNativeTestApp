# ReactNativeTestApp
Test application with React Native + TypeScript + MobX + React Navigation

**TypeScript** - because JS is a nightmare.

**React Navigation** - navigation between the screens.
- Repo - https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation
- Useful auth flow guide - https://reactnavigation.org/docs/auth-flow/

**MobX** - state management library. This adds reactive to the React. Much easier that Redux for understanding if you are a mobile developer.
If you a Xamarin developer, this is like ReactiveUI with observables and observers.
- Repo - https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx
- Mobx + React guides - https://mobx-react.js.org/ This site is more useful than the https://mobx.js.org/ which have some outdated guides.

Also there is **redux** branch where I tried to implement some logic using the Redux to compare with the MobX.
